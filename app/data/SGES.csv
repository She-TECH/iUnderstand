I don't find space to grow personally or professionally within the organization. I am in a perpetual state of unsatisfactory work.
The professional growth is not good at siemens. We remain on the same role as such there is no change in the role from long time. I am not able to see my career growth at siemens.

Good
Good policy regarding heath & safety
Good initiatives by LOB for health and happiness of employees
Working on the same things for years and no movement has made me stale and has affected my mental health
Only favorite people get good hike not the deserving candidate

Renumeration & benefits should be improved as per current market trend.
there is a vast room of improvement
